  inertia_weight: 1000.0  # The strength of the penalty on the difference between the input and the output depth map on observed pixels. Set this value higher if you want to maintain the observed depth from input_depth.
  smoothness_weight: 0.001  # The strength of the penalty on the difference between the depths of neighboring pixels. Higher smoothness weight will produce soap-film-like result.
  tangent_weight: 1.0  # The universal strength of the surface normal constraint. Higher tangent weight will force the output to have the same surface normal with the given one.

# Values Used for RGB Visualization of depth images  in saved results
depthVisualization:
  minDepth: 0.1  # meters. Depth less than this value not considered in creating rgb visualization of depth.
  maxDepth: 1.5  # meters. Depth more than this value not considered in creating rgb visualization of depth.

#   'mask' - Get mask of transparent objects using DNN and delete all those pixels from input depth
